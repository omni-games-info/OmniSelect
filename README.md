# OmniSelect

OmniSelect is a core tool in the **Omni Games Ecosystem**, designed for building curated, device-optimized ROM collections.

It allows users to construct personalized ROM sets tailored to their storage devices and workflows. User selections are stored in a **user database**, while the `OMNI_DAT` database automatically tracks and updates the metadata for each ROM entry. Once finalized, collections can be **viewed publicly by other users** and **downloaded as `.dat` files**, allowing sharing and integration with other tools.

- **Personalized Collection Building** – Select specific games, regions, and versions to create clean, optimized sets.  
- **User Database Storage** – Selections are saved in a dedicated user database for editing, review, and ongoing management.  
- **Automatic Metadata Updates** – The `OMNI_DAT` database ensures that metadata for every ROM entry remains current and accurate.
