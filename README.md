# OmniSelect

OmniSelect is a core tool in the **Omni Games Ecosystem**, designed for building curated, device-optimized ROM collections.

It allows users to construct personalized ROM sets tailored to their storage devices and workflows. User selections are stored in a **user database**, while the `OMNI_DAT` database automatically tracks and updates metadata for each ROM entry. Once finalized, collections can be **viewed publicly by other users** and **downloaded as `.dat` files**, enabling sharing and integration with other tools.

OmniSelect runs entirely online — there is no need to install Python or any additional software, and users do not need to manage versions or updates. This makes it accessible and easy to use for anyone.
