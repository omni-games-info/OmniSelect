# OmniSelect

OmniSelect is a core tool in the **Omni Games Ecosystem**, designed for building curated, device-optimized ROM collections.

It allows users to construct personalized ROM sets tailored to their storage devices and workflows. User selections are stored in the `OMNI_DAT` database, which automatically updates the metadata values for each entry, and the finalized collection can be exported as a `.dat` file for use with compatible tools and systems.

## Overview

OmniSelect provides:

- **Personalized Collection Building** – Select specific games, regions, and versions to create clean, optimized sets.  
- **Database-Backed Storage** – All selections are saved in the `OMNI_DAT` database, which ensures metadata for each entry is automatically updated.  
- **Export as `.dat` Files** – Once your collection is finalized, OmniSelect generates a `.dat` file for integration with other tools or devices.  
- **Device Optimization** – Adjust collection size to match storage constraints of your target device.  
- **Integration with Omni Ecosystem** – Works seamlessly with Omni1, OmniScope, and OmniBridge for a complete ROM management workflow.  

OmniSelect is designed for collectors, preservationists, and anyone managing ROM libraries efficiently.
